# Portfolio-MIARFID 

This repository contains a set of projects developed during Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, and Digital Imaging at Universitat Politècnica de València.


## Neural Machine Translation from Python to C++
This project compares the performance of various fine-tuned models for translating code snippets between Python and C++, using BLEU, CodeBLEU, and COMET metrics on translations and executions. 

## Speech Translation from Latvian to English
This projects explores speech translation using Whisper end-to-end approach and a cascade approach of Whisper transcription and neural machine translation using different (NLLB) models. 

## POS Tagging
This work involves training several models based on the Transformer architecture to address the problem of Part-Of-Speech tagging on a Spanish corpus, reduced to 66 distinct tags. Specifically, MarIA and BETO are compared with the classical TnT and HMM models. Additionally, the usefulness of fine-tuning large language models—specifically the second version of LLaMa—is evaluated for this same task.

## RAG Bot integrated with Slack for Hyperloop UPV
This project develops a Slack-integrated chatbot for the Hyperloop UPV team using GPT-3.5 Turbo. It can handle tasks like answering questions about past projects and retrieving images based on prompts. The tool helps address high team turnover by preserving and sharing technical knowledge efficiently.

## Neuroevolution using Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing
This work presents FakeNEAT, a neuroevolution method based on NEAT that combines genetic algorithms and simulated annealing to modify both the architecture and the weights of neural networks simultaneously. The document details how the different components of the algorithm work, its implementation and usage, and shows results on various datasets.
