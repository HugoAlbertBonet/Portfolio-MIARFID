# Portfolio-MIARFID 

This repository contains a set of projects developed during Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, and Digital Imaging at Universitat Politècnica de València.


## Neural Machine Translation from Python to C++
This project compares the performance of various fine-tuned models for translating code snippets between Python and C++, using BLEU, CodeBLEU, and COMET metrics on translations and executions. 

## Speech Translation from Latvian to English
This projects explores speech translation using Whisper end-to-end approach and a cascade approach of Whisper transcription and neural machine translation using different (NLLB) models.
